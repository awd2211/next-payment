## Design System Established

### Border Radius Standards
```
Cards:               12px
Buttons/Inputs:       8px
Tags:                12px
Alerts:               8px
Modals:        Default (16px from Ant Design)
```

### Typography Standards
```
Page Title:          32px (Title level={2})
Card Title:          16px (default)
Statistic Title:     14px, weight 500
Statistic Value:     24-36px, weight 600-700
Body Text:           14px (default)
Secondary Text:      12px, color #999
```

### Loading States Strategy
- **Skeleton screens**: For statistics cards (better perceived performance)
- **Spinner**: For table data
- **Button loading**: For actions
- **Separate states**: `statsLoading` vs `loading` for non-blocking UI

### Smart Filters Pattern
- Badge count showing active filters
- Clear filters button (only visible when active)
- FilterOutlined icon
- Badge color: #1890ff (blue)

### Interactive Feedback
- **Copy buttons**: Turn primary + CheckOutlined for 2 seconds
- **Hover effects**: Cards with `transition: 'all 0.3s ease'`
- **Tooltips**: On all icon buttons and truncated text
- **Disabled states**: Gray out unavailable actions
